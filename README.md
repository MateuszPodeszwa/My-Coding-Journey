# My Coding Journey (MCJ)

Welcome to "My Coding Journey," a repository dedicated to sharing and learning about coding experiences. This repository, abbreviated as MCY, serves as a platform for developers of all levels to explore various programming topics, from basic concepts to advanced techniques.

## Purpose of this Repository

Originally envisioned as a .pdf document or potentially a book, this repository was moved to GitHub to make it more accessible to the global development community. Here, you'll find a wealth of information on a variety of programming languages and technologies, including C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more. Our goal is to create a collaborative space where users can freely share and expand their coding knowledge.

### Usage and Contribution

Feel free to use the information in this repository as a reference or learning resource. There is no obligation to link back to this repository, but if you find it valuable, we would appreciate a link or a donation to support our work.

If you have expertise in a topic not yet covered, or if you see areas for improvement, we encourage you to contribute. You can create a pull request or contact the repository owner to request writing access. Please ensure that all contributions are accurate and presented in a beginner-friendly manner.

## Guidelines for Contributors

1. **Respectful Communication**: Always maintain a respectful tone. Critique constructively and consider the diverse backgrounds of our contributors and readers.
2. **Correct Information**: Ensure that the content you add is accurate. Our goal is to be a reliable source of knowledge for the community.
3. **Clear and Simple Structure**: Use Markdown for all documentation. Organize your contributions to be easy to follow. While you have creative freedom in structuring your work, consider using existing branches as templates for consistency.
4. **Beginner-Friendly Language**: If you are writing tutorials from scratch, avoid using overly technical jargon unless it is clearly explained. Remember that many users may be new to programming.

## Branch Management

- Each new topic should be developed in a separate branch named clearly, e.g., `csharp-course` or `php-tutorial`.
- Do not edit or upload content to branches created by others without permission.
- If you use an advanced Markdown editor like Obsidian MD, note this in the branch's README to avoid confusion.

## IDE Recommendations

While you are free to use any IDE that supports Markdown, we recommend using [Obsidian MD](https://obsidian.md/), a free note-taking app that offers advanced features for Markdown editing.

## Support and Donations

If you find value in this project and wish to support it, consider donating. You can do so via Patreon, bank transfer, or another method of your choice. For any questions or issues, please open an issue on GitHub or contact us directly.

Thank you for contributing to and supporting "My Coding Journey"!
